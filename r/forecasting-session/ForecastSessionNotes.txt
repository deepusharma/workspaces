Prediction --> Regression --> Cross-sectional analaysis --> Regression 
---------------

- cross section --> data at a point of time, no time dimension 

- scatter plot is between 2 quantitative values e.g. age and weight ->> to understand the relationship between the variables.

Forecasting 
---------------
- longitudanal --> timeseries data  
- data across time diemnsion 
- movement of variables with time



Techniques for timeseries forecasting: 
- Smoothing (non-modelling - no univeral model estimation)
- Modelling (Box-Jenkins ARIMA model) 


- Model --> Equation  (variables + constants/coefficients)

Moving Average (Smoothing) Techniques: 
- Simple moving average
	- Equal weightages. 
- Weighted Moving Average 
	- how do we assign weight? 
		- random - trial and error ; build multiple forecast and check with actual 
		- Basd on historical evidence, take the average of months 
- Single Exponential Moving Average
- Double Exponential Moving Average (Holts Winter) --> Includes Level and Trend 
- Triple Exponential --> includes Seasonality as well 

MAD --> Mean Average Deviation   --> take absolute value of difference and add it up to calculate mean
MSE --> Mean Square Error  --> Square the difference and add it up to calculate mean

Need to get Less MSE and MAD



Times series has following components:
 - level, season and trend components 
 
- We have used smothing on only level components. 
- So for Double Exponential smoothing technique takes into consideration Trend component as well 
 
 
- Forecase = Sum of Level and Trend 
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
- Time Series Decomposition 

Seasonality --> Local fluctuation 
Cyclical --> Business cycle in a long term 
 
 
 
--> random component --> Besides seasonal, trend, level  Residual, error, innovation
  --> No trend is possible in random component
  --> 
  
  
--> there are 2 types of decomposition --> additive and multiplicative (of components - level, trend, seasonality and random)
--> If the spikes are also getting increasing, flcutations are becoming more and more. Hence we need to use multiplicative analysis. 

For additive series --> take average and find out difference for the month. 
For multiplicative --> try toi find the factor --> that will become multiplicative index



*** Converting multiplicative series into additive --> 
- use log transformation 


-----------------------------------------------------

Till now we have seen smoothing techniques 
- there was no algebraic equation that could help us in getting to predictive value
- for this, we need to use modelling technique --> 



*** Auto-correlation -> when current value (say price of stock), depends on the past value. Future depends on past so use it to forecast future
*** Random component, error, residual, innovation etc.. --> actual minus forecast 

** Auto-regression --? when I am trying to regress my dependent variables using past values of same variables

*** independent varliables:
	- Own past values --> Auto Regression
	- Past innovation --> Moving Average (requires moving average of the error) 
	
	ARMA --> Auto Regressive Moving Average --> Combination of above 2 
	
	ARIMA -->> BOX-JENKIS --> Auto Regressive INTEGRATED Moving Average

--> Modelling--> No auto-correlation be left 
--> 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stationarity -->

- Constant mean
- constant variance 

- to test if series is stationary or not --> Dicky fuller (??). Based on statistical test  (ADF, PP, KPSS) 
- ACF will be between -1 to +1 
- for 0 lag it will be 1
- high auto correlation --> there is a trend in the series 
- 	


** Null hypothesis 
-- 

Univaraiate = > 

How many variable variables you are predicting --? 
Multivariate --> Predict more than one variable 

--> for Multi --> Vector ARMA

Risks 
 - Systematic  - e.g. demonetization 
 - Non-systematic/Idiosyncratic Risk  - e.g change in management of company. So only 
 
 - whenever idiosynchratic risk can be avoided by portofio diversification. 
 - Systematic cant be mitigated 
 
 
 Rf - Returns - Risk freee 
 Ra - Returns - Risk for asset class
 Rm - 
 b (beta) = (Ra - Rf)/(Ra - Rm)
 
 b is Cov(m,a)/var(m)

 b is the measure of flucuation of (measure of sensitivity of asset to the market ) 
 
 
 if b is high, risk will be high. 
 
 - CAPM - Capital Asset Pricing Model: 
 
 
 - when asset is correlated to market, risk for asset is similar to market risk.
